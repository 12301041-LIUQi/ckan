# sudo apt-get install python-pybabel python-psycopg2 python-lxml
# sudo apt-get install python-pylons python-repoze.who
# sudo apt-get install python-repoze.who-plugins python-tempita python-zope.interface

psycopg2==2.0.13
# Specifying particular version of WebOb because later version has incompatibility
# with pylons 0.9.7 (change to imports of Multidict)
webob==1.0.8
Pylons==0.9.7
# These are both combined into the python-repoze.who-plugins package
# Actually from python-repoze.who-plugins but the openid plugin in the same
# package is too old
pastescript==1.7.3

# NOTE: Developers, please do not edit the versions, these versions are fixed
#       in Lucid. If you start to depend on a different vesion you'll need to
#       remove the version here and package your version as a conflict.
